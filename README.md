This repository includes all the simulations from the paper [Adaptive sparse group lasso in quantile regression](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11634-020-00413-8)

The simulations were run in Python 2.7 and make intensive use of packages `cvxpy` and `multiprocessing`, but a new version of this code for python 3.7 can be found in (link to github package). This is a link to the ASGL package, that implements all the penalized models that can be observed in these simulations.
